      "featureTitle": "Add a Mic button inside the NoteModal component (frontend/src/components/notes/NoteModal.tsx) in the note body (and title) input area. When tapped, use the browser's built-in Web Speech API (SpeechRecognition / webkitSpeechRecognition) to start live speech-to-text transcription. Transcribed text must be inserted/appended at the current cursor position in whichever field (title or body) is active. Provide stop/pause and resume controls. If SpeechRecognition is not supported, show an inline message: 'Speech-to-text not supported on this browser.' Do not store any raw audio — only the resulting text is saved. Transcription must not disrupt normal keyboard typing/editing, and the note must continue to save normally via the existing save flow.",

This must appear as a minimal addition in the existing note actions area (e.g., NoteModal or NoteCard context menu — whichever already has export/action options) without changing any existing controls. The export must generate a .DOC file (Word-compatible HTML document). Optionally also offer .PDF export if it can be done fully client-side without a server or external library that is complex to integrate; otherwise skip PDF and only provide DOC. The exported document must include: the note title, the note body with line breaks preserved, labels/tags displayed as a small line below the title, and the created/updated date-time formatted using the same format used elsewhere in the app (per frontend/src/utils/dateFormatter.ts, e.g. '28 Feb 2026, 3:45 AM'). The filename format must be: NoteTitle_YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM.doc (or .pdf). Export must work entirely client-side with no server calls.",
