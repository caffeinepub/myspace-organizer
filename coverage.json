The exported file must be named routines_YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM.(txt|doc|json) using the current local date and time.

When clicked, it uses the browser Web Speech API (SpeechRecognition / webkitSpeechRecognition) to start speech recognition, shows live interim transcription, and appends/inserts the final transcribed text into the active input field (title or notes). A second click (or a Stop button) ends recognition. Do not store audio — only the resulting text string. This addition must not interfere with manual typing or the save/submit flow.
