# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add real-time clock to the home page date display, introduce yellow/gold accent color options, and change the default theme to light.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the Home page date display to also show the current time (e.g., "Monday, June 10 · 3:45 PM"), updating in real time
- Add Yellow, Gold, and Golden Yellow as selectable accent color options in the Settings page color picker, with corresponding color tokens in the app's color system
- Change the app's default theme to light so first-time visitors see the light theme; existing saved preferences are preserved

**User-visible outcome:** Users see the current time alongside the date on the home page, can choose from new yellow and gold accent colors that apply app-wide, and the app opens in light mode by default for new visitors.
