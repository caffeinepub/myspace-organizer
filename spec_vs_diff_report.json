  "summary": "The diff implements most of the requested requirements: REQ-1 (formatDateTime utility), REQ-2 (partial - several pages updated but NoteCard.tsx and NoteModal.tsx are missing), REQ-3 (gold presets in SettingsPage), REQ-4 (luminance-based text color via --accent-text), REQ-5 (three CSS variables in appStore), and REQ-6 (accent applied to nav, buttons, streak ring, routines). However, NoteCard.tsx and NoteModal.tsx are not present in the diff, meaning note timestamps are not updated. StreakWidget.tsx is also absent. The index.css files are not shown as updated with the new CSS variables declared at :root. Habit log entry timestamps and todo due/created dates are not explicitly shown as updated.",
