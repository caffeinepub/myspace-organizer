  "summary": "Both REQ-1 (Mic/Speech-to-Text) and REQ-2 (Export as Document) are substantially implemented. A useSpeechRecognition hook, noteExport utility, and NoteModal modifications are present. However, several specific acceptance criteria cannot be fully verified from the truncated diff, and one AC item (pause/resume controls distinct from stop) appears potentially missing.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Provide stop/pause AND resume controls while recording (pause and resume are distinct from stop).",
      "reason": "The useSpeechRecognition hook exposes only startListening and stopListening with no explicit pause/resume distinction. The NoteModal diff is truncated so UI controls cannot be fully verified, but the hook itself provides no pause/resume API.",

      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Transcribed text must be inserted/appended at the current cursor position in whichever field (title or body) is active.",
      "reason": "The NoteModal diff is truncated after the transcript-appending useEffect begins. Active field tracking and lastTranscriptRef are set up, but the actual cursor-position insertion logic (selectionStart/selectionEnd) cannot be confirmed from the truncated content.",
