  "summary": "The diff implements most requirements: Google Fonts are added to index.html, Tailwind fontFamily is extended, SettingsPage has a Font Family dropdown, QuotePage extends its font options, and appStore/storage.ts are noted in file summaries as updated. However, the diff does not directly show the contents of storage.ts or appStore.ts — only file summaries reference them. The index.html has preconnect tags present for the first Google Fonts link. One notable issue: appStore.ts and storage.ts changes are only described in file summaries, not shown directly in diff content.",
