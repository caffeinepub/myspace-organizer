REQ-2 (yellow/gold/golden-yellow accent colors) is implemented in appStore.ts and SettingsPage.tsx, but index.css and tailwind.config.js changes are not evidenced in the diff. REQ-3 (default light theme) is implemented in appStore.ts and storage.ts.",

      "reason": "The diff shows OKLCH tokens added in appStore.ts and hex colors in SettingsPage.tsx, but no changes to index.css or tailwind.config.js are present in the diff. The build request specifically calls out both files for color token definitions.",
